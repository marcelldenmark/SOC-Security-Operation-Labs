# SOC Security Operations Labs – Fusion Center Readiness

This repository demonstrates hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) skills aligned with enterprise and financial services environments. The focus is on alert triage, endpoint investigation, incident documentation, and operational decision-making consistent with a Security Fusion Center.

## Scope
- SIEM-style alert triage and investigation
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) analysis
- Incident scoping, escalation, and closure decisions
- IOC identification and evidence documentation
- False-positive analysis and alert tuning concepts
- Operational security documentation and runbooks

## Tools & Concepts
- SIEM alert workflows (Splunk / Sentinel-style)
- Endpoint security investigation (Defender / CrowdStrike-style)
- Identity and authentication events
- Logging & monitoring (structured logs)
- Incident response lifecycle (Detect → Triage → Contain → Document)

## Environment
All alerts and investigations are simulated or sanitized to reflect realistic enterprise scenarios without exposing sensitive data.

## Objective
Demonstrate Tier 1–2 SOC analyst readiness for a Security Fusion Center supporting a regulated financial institution.
